THINGS TO DO AND FIX:

 - modify ride history to use GAE backend
 - update javascript to deal with schema change underlying events
    do I need to worry about event IDs being stored for passing to
      eventinfo window generator?
    do I need to worry about indexes in the ride path? I think I can just
      use whatever index I want.
