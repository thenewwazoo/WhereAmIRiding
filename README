Paid options?
 - caching of data is pretty obvious
 - maybe viewing more than a certain amount of a rider's history? probably not.
 - custom images and URLs!
 - ideally, paid options would be bought by the rider, not the viewer, and would include some sort of
    back-end data munging or storage.
 - maybe a paid option could be unlimited (or even just >1) info data feeds (latitude? other?)

URLs ending with a slash are for getting information, or for 
 situations where a useful response is expected.

Examples:
 /eventinfo/<userid>/<eventid>/    -- Gets information about an event
 /register/                        -- Gets information about registering

---

URLs not ending in slashes can be thought of as commands, or
 for situations where a useful response is NOT expected. These are
 not exposed to end-users

Examples:
 /cache/update                     -- Triggers an update of the cache

web/ is the standard distribution of web.py. easiest just to check it in here.

---

GAE requires that you compile templates. to do that, run
$ python web/template.py --compile templates

this code works best when modified while listening to trance or house music.
