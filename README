URLs ending with a slash are for getting information, or for 
 situations where a useful response is expected.

Examples:
 /eventinfo/<userid>/<eventid>/    -- Gets information about an event
 /register/                        -- Gets information about registering

---

URLs not ending in slashes can be thought of as commands, or
 for situations where a useful response is NOT expected. These are
 not exposed to end-users

Examples:
 /cache/update                     -- Triggers an update of the cache

web/ is the standard distribution of web.py. easiest just to check it in here.

---

GAE requires that you compile templates. to do that, run
$ python web/template.py --compile templates

this code works best when modified while listening to trance or house music.
